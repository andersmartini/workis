#Workis

simple time tracker CLI written in rust.

This project is WIP.

Missing features:


- subcommand to create a summary of a months work, calculating total hours etc. possibly export in several formats? (csv, text....?)

- subcommand to step through each date in the month and easily make corrections as needed. 

- support for several projects using a project argument (probably storing each projects files in subfolders)

- ability to configure default values for project and lunchbreak arguments(possibly other arguments too?)

- store what project is passed to the start command, and have the done command read that and store it accordingly
